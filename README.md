# Assignment-3
Assignment 3 This assignment contains two Python programs:  Files  factorial.py Calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user. Includes both iterative and recursive methods using functions. Handles invalid inputs like negative numbers.  mathsCalculation.py Asks the user for a number and calculates: Square root (if valid) Natural logarithm (ln) (if valid) Sine of the number (in radians) Uses Python's math module. Handles invalid inputs gracefully.  How to Run Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.6+ recommended). Open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the folder containing the files.  Run the programs: python factorial.py python mathsCalculation.py  Example  factorial.py Enter a number: 5 The factorial of 5 is 120.  mathsCalculation.py Enter a number: 4 Results for number 4.0: Square root: 2.0 Natural logarithm (ln): 1.3862943611198906 Sine (in radians): -0.7568024953079282  Notes Both programs validate user input and print helpful messages if the input is invalid.  mathsCalculation.py works in the real number system; square root and logarithm are undefined for certain inputs (like negative numbers).
